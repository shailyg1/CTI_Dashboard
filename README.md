## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up and run the CTI Dashboard locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

  * **Python 3.8+**
  * **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
  * **npm** or **Yarn**

### 1\. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine:bash
git clone [https://github.com/X5464/Cti-dashboard.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/X5464/Cti-dashboard.git)
cd Cti-dashboard

````

### 2. Backend Setup (Flask)

Navigate into the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
````

Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Configure Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. This file will store your API keys and database connection string.

```dotenv
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_virustotal_api_key
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=your_abuseipdb_api_key
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
```

  * **VirusTotal API Key:** Obtain your API key from the(https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us). Be aware that public API keys have rate limits (e.g., a certain number of requests per minute and per day). Exceeding these limits may result in temporary blocking of your key.
  * **AbuseIPDB API Key:** Obtain your API key from the(https://www.abuseipdb.com/register). This API also has usage limits, so manage your requests accordingly.
  * **MongoDB Atlas Connection String:** The project utilizes **MongoDB Atlas (Free Tier)** for its cloud database. You can set up a free cluster on the(https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register). Ensure your connection string includes your database name and credentials.

### 3\. Frontend Setup (React)

Navigate back to the root directory of the project and then into the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd../frontend
```

Install the Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install # or yarn install
```

**Configure Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory.

```dotenv
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000 # Or your deployed backend URL if applicable
```

## üöÄ Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are set up, you can run the CTI Dashboard:

### 1\. Start the Backend Server

From the `backend` directory (with your virtual environment activated):

```bash
flask run
```

The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2\. Start the Frontend Application

From the `frontend` directory:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

The frontend application will open in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can now use the dashboard to:
